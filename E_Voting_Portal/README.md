## Technologies Used

### Frontend:

JSP (JavaServer Pages): For dynamic web content generation and presentation.
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript: For structuring, styling, and interactivity.
JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library): For simplifying JSP development.
Font Awesome: For icons.

### Backend:

Java Servlets: For handling HTTP requests and business logic.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): For database interaction.

### Database:

Oracle Database: Used for storing all application data (users, elections, candidates, votes, etc.).

### Server:

Apache Tomcat: The web server and servlet container for deploying the application.

### Build Tool (Implicit):

Apache Maven / Apache Ant (or Eclipse Built-in): While not explicitly mentioned, typically used for project structure, dependency management, and building WAR files. (You can specify if you used Maven or Ant).

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the E-Voting Portal up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

    **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher (e.g., JDK 8, JDK 11).
    
    **Apache Tomcat**: Version 7.0.x or higher (e.g., Tomcat 9.x, Tomcat 10.x recommended for newer JDKs).
    **Oracle Database**: An accessible Oracle instance (e.g., Oracle XE, or a full instance).
    **SQL Developer / SQL*Plus**: For database schema setup.
    **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers recommended.
    Database Setup
    **Connect to Oracle**: Use SQL Developer or SQL*Plus to connect to your Oracle database instance.
    **Create User (Optional but Recommended)**: Create a dedicated user for the application (e.g., EVOTING_USER).

## SQL

CREATE USER EVOTING_USER IDENTIFIED BY your_password;
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE, CREATE VIEW TO EVOTING_USER;
GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO EVOTING_USER; -- For simplicity, adjust permissions as needed

Run Schema Script: Execute the SQL script (you'll need to create this) to set up the necessary tables (e.g., users, elections, candidates, votes, constituencies, etc.).

Note: You will need to create schema.sql (or similar) file with your table creation DDL.

**Example (Conceptual)**:

SQL

-- Create USERS table
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR2(100) UNIQUE,
    role VARCHAR2(20) DEFAULT 'voter' NOT NULL, -- 'admin', 'voter', 'candidate'
    status VARCHAR2(20) DEFAULT 'pending' NOT NULL -- 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
);

-- Create ELECTIONS table
CREATE TABLE elections (
    election_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR2(500),
    start_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    end_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR2(20) DEFAULT 'upcoming' NOT NULL -- 'upcoming', 'active', 'completed', 'cancelled'
);

-- Add other tables like CANDIDATES, VOTES, CONSTITUENCIES etc.
Configure DBConnection.java: Update your database connection utility (com.evoting.util.DBConnection or similar) with your Oracle database URL, username, and password.
Java

// Example snippet (adjust according to your actual DBConnection class)
private static final String JDBC_URL = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE"; // Or your service name/SID
private static final String DB_USER = "EVOTING_USER";
private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "your_password";

### Add Oracle JDBC Driver:

Download the ojdbcX.jar (e.g., ojdbc8.jar for Java 8) compatible with your Oracle version.
Place this JAR file in your Tomcat's lib directory (e.g., apache-tomcat-X.X.X/lib/). This makes the driver available to all web applications deployed on that Tomcat instance.
Alternatively, if using Maven, ensure the dependency is correctly configured in your pom.xml:

XML

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.oracle.database.jdbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>ojdbc8</artifactId>
    <version>12.2.0.1</version> </dependency>

## Application Deployment

Clone the Repository:

            git clone https://github.com/DarylAdrien/Advanced_java_programming.git
            cd E_Voting_Portal

Import into Eclipse:

Open Eclipse.
Go to File > Import... > Maven > Existing Maven Projects (if using Maven) or General > Existing Projects into Workspace.
Browse to the cloned e-voting-portal directory and select it.
Click Finish.

Configure Tomcat in Eclipse:

In the Servers view (Window > Show View > Servers), create a new Tomcat server if you haven't already.
Point it to your Apache Tomcat installation directory.
Add the e-voting-portal project to this Tomcat server.

Clean and Build:

Right-click on your project in Eclipse's Package Explorer.
Select Maven > Update Project... (if using Maven) or Project > Clean....
Ensure there are no build errors.

Start Tomcat:

In the Servers view, right-click on your configured Tomcat server.
Select Start.
Usage
Open your web browser.
Navigate to http://localhost:8080/e-voting-portal/ (or whatever context path you have configured).

Register: Create a new voter account through the registration page.

Admin Access: To access the admin panel, you'll likely need to manually update a user's role in the database to 'admin' initially.

SQL

UPDATE users SET role = 'admin', status = 'approved' WHERE username = 'your_admin_username';
COMMIT;

Explore the different functionalities as a voter, candidate, or administrator.
